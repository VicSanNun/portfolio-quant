[Gaussian Process applied to Cosmology](https://github.com/VicSanNun/HzRegression/blob/main/main.ipynb)

The objective of this work is to study different approaches to the reconstruction of the **Universe Expansion Rate**, $H(z)$, using data from cosmic chronometers, through Gaussian Processes and MCMC (Monte Carlo-Markov Chain).
